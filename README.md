# Functions Framework for .NET

An open source framework for writing lightweight, portable C# functions that
run in a serverless environment. Functions written to this Framework will run
in many different environments, including:

*  [Cloud Run or Cloud Run for Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/run)
*  Any other [Knative](https://github.com/knative)-based environment
*  Your local development machine

The framework allows you to go from:

```
...
```

To:

```sh
curl http://my-url
# Output: Hello, world!
```

All without needing to worry about writing an HTTP server or complicated
request handling logic.
